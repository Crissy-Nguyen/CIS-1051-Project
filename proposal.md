# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Hopper


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Using either Pygame or Love2D, I will be making a simple platformer with a goal at the end of the level.


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I intend this project to be, at its core, a Mario-styled platformer, having enemies and objects in the environment for the player to interact with.
For the character that the player controls, I plan to give it a little more depth than just walking left or right and jumping; it could be something along the lines of crouching, wall jumping, etc.
The player should have a health bar where, if they've been attacked by either an obstacle or an enemy (usually by getting too close), they'll lose a heart.
Running out of hearts will result in a Game Over screen, which afterwards should either close the window or prompt the user if they want to retry the level.
The player's objectitve is to reach the goal that lies at the end of the side-scrolling level.
When the player comes in contact with the goal, a win screen should appear, and should either close the window afterward or prompt the user if they want to play the game again.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable


## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

At the very least, I should have the basic framework of the controls and physics complete.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In a better scenario, I could have the programming for the player actions and/or enemies made.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I don't expect what I may have at the end of this deadline to be too polished, but just having almost everything implemented in some way, shape, or form, is what I'd call ideal, given my current skill. On top of that, if I could somehow draw some of my assets myself, that'd be nice too.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Whether I'm using Pygame or Love2D, I'll have to look up on how to create some sort of physics for my game, since I've decided on this instead of a top-down game.
Currently, I'm somewhat used to creating inputs via the keyboard, but properly creating physics and collision will likely be my biggest challenge but also my most crucial aspects of making the game.
These aspects are essential to games like Super Mario, where it's important to create an interactive environment, mostly through how the player comes in contact with the things around them, like jumping on a enemy or bumping your head on a block.
