# CIS-1051-Project

### What to Know about the Project:
- Snake-inspired 2D platformer
- The main core of the game is complete, with some aspects still unpolished.
- The most challenging part was implementing level randomization (which still needs tweaking).
- Sprites in the game were made by me using Aseprite.
