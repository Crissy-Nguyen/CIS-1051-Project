Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

For my Snake-inspired platformer, I've managed to complete the following:
- The player and the controls
- The world that is comprised of blocks for the player to stand on, and spikes that damage the player
- My own sprites for the game; everything seen on the game, I drew with a pixel art software called Aseprite
- A Retry button that resets the player's position and the world's layout, for the player to try the game again

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still need to find a way to implement the following:
- A counter to keep track of the player's score
- Collectible food that when the player collects them, the world's layout randomizes and the player's score updates

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

None yet, but I suspect there to be a bit of difficulty in finding out how to implement the collectible food that will alter the world's layout.
